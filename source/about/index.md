Youth is not a time of life,it is a state of mind
it is not a matter of rosy cheeks,red lips adn supple knees.
it is a matter of will,a auality of the imagination,a vigor of the emotions;
it is the freshness of the deep springs of life.
Youth means a temperamental predominance of courage over timidity, of the appetite for adventure over the love of ease.
this often exists in a man of sixty more than a boy of twenty
nobody grows old merely by a number of years
we grow old by deserting our ideals.
